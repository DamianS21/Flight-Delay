# Flight-Delay 2015
This project is made to analyse, understand and make model of Flight Delays Data from 2015. This data set is part of kaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

## Files description
Project consists of 4 files. 
1) Flight_data_transformation.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that contains data understanding, and data manipulation
2) Flights_data_visualization.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that constains visualizaiton of data. It includes charts, tables and other required for data interpretation.
3) **main_Flights_delays.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook that have modeling data and mashine learning alogirthms to predict delation of flights
4) flight_data_transformation.py - Python file that constains functions from Flight_data_transformation.ipynb notebook
